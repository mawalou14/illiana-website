# Illiana Antique Power Association
Hey there! This repo has the code for the Illiana Antique Power Association's website, built in Angular 10.
It also contains all the newsletters that have been published, dating back to 2004. These can be found under `illiana-app/src/assets/newsletters`.

This site was originally taken from an HTML5 template built by BootstrapMade.
It was built with a bunch of JavaScript and HTML files though, so I decided to rebuild it with Angular to make things easier to manage.

If you'd like to run the app yourself, just follow the instructions in the README file under the `illiana-app` folder.
